# ZaioLevel2_JsChallenges
This are challenges completed on level 2 of the Zaio Web Dev course

The reason for the ES5 versions of the program is because Zaio may not support anything beyond ES6 yet. 
I tried running my original challenges on it and it could not recognise the class syntax and the Array.include() method
